# Hotel Reservation Cancellation Analysis

This project performs an analysis of a hotel reservation dataset to explore key insights related to reservation cancellations. By utilizing powerful data analysis libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`, the project investigates various aspects of reservation cancellations, such as patterns over time, hotel type comparisons, country-wise cancellations, and the impact of different market segments. The analysis also focuses on the Average Daily Rate (ADR) to provide a deeper understanding of revenue trends between canceled and non-canceled reservations.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and formatting date columns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data using various plots to uncover patterns and trends.
- **Reservation Cancellations**: Insights into cancellation rates for City and Resort Hotels, and across different countries and market segments.
- **Revenue Insights**: Detailed look into the Average Daily Rate (ADR) trends over time and by hotel type, showing differences between canceled and non-canceled bookings.

## Data
The dataset contains detailed information about hotel bookings, including:
- Reservation status (canceled or not canceled)
- Hotel type (City or Resort)
- Average Daily Rate (ADR)
- Reservation dates, room types, and country of the guest

## Visualizations
This project uses several types of visualizations, such as:
- Bar charts for reservation statuses
- Line plots to visualize ADR trends over time
- Count plots for cancellations based on hotel type and market segment
- Pie charts for cancellation rates by country

## Analysis Goals
- Identify the key factors that contribute to hotel reservation cancellations.
- Examine revenue trends for different hotel types.
- Provide actionable insights to help hotels optimize their booking strategies and reduce cancellation rates.
